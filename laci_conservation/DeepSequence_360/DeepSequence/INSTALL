DeepSequence is built with python2.7 and uses the Theano library for GPU and CPU
acceleration. You can use an existing installation of python2.7 and install the
necessary packages, but if this is not possible or you would like a fresh slate,
we recommend using the Anaconda python package manager (using version 2.7):

https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos

Once this is installed, Theano will need to be installed. The instructions can
be found here:

http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html

Theano can speed up both CPU and GPU functions used commonly in mathematical and
deep learning frameworks. We recommend fitting models and predicting the effects
of mutations with a GPU-enabled machine for orders of magnitude faster
performance, but it is not required. Information for getting CUDA installed to
use the GPU can be found at the above link, and will need to be installed from
here:
